# Ember Components First

This is a repo with examples, speaker notes, slides, and more for the [Ember: Understanding Components First](https://www.meetup.com/nashjs/events/kfhvnnyxpbsb/) talk given at NashJS in November 2018.

Included in this repo are:

* [Speaker Notes](talk.md)
* [Ember App Example](game-list)
* [Equivalent React Example](react-example)
* [Server](server)
* [Slides](slides)

The React example included in this repo covers the content from the talk live coding with some refactoring to use Context for managing data.

The slides are plain HTML but don't have much info except how to follow me on the Sosh-Meeds (social media).

## Following Along At Home

If you would like to follow along to get started run:

```
yarn global add ember-cli@latest
ember new game-list --no-welcome --yarn
cd game-list
ember install ember-decorators
```
